# Accessible Menu

## About

Basic accessible menu interaction. Allows the tier one menu items to link to pages while keeping the drop down usable for tab navigation. Uses [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/).

Based off Approach 2 from https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/menus/flyout/#flyoutnavmousefixed.

Handling all logic in JS so it's not split between CSS and JS. The mouseenter part could be done in CSS if desired.

## Usage

- Run `npm install`
- Run `npm run start`
